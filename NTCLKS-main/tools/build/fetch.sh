# Fetch and verify the downloads recorded in configs/dependencies.lock.json.
#
# This is the only regular network stage. A build never calls it: the build asks
# for the cache to already hold the bytes (--verify-only) and stops with the
# dependency id and this command when it does not, so an unreachable mirror can
# never turn a normal build into a download.
#
# Concurrency needs no lock file. Each process writes its own partial file and
# publishes it with link(), which is atomic: two racing fetches of the same
# dependency both verify, one link wins, and the loser's copy is discarded.
